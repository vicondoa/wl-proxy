//! configure a xkb key binding, receive trigger events
//!
//! This object allows the window manager to configure a xkbcommon key binding
//! and receive events when the key binding is triggered.
//!
//! The new key binding is not enabled until the enable request is made during
//! a manage sequence.
//!
//! Normally, all key events are sent to the surface with keyboard focus by
//! the compositor. Key events that trigger a key binding are not sent to the
//! surface with keyboard focus.
//!
//! If multiple key bindings would be triggered by a single physical key event
//! on the compositor side, it is compositor policy which key binding(s) will
//! receive press/release events or if all of the matched key bindings receive
//! press/release events.
//!
//! Key bindings might be matched by the same physical key event due to shared
//! keysym and modifiers. The layout override feature may also cause the same
//! physical key event to trigger two key bindings with different keysyms and
//! different layout overrides configured.
