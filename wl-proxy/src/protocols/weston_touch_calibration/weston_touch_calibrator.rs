//! calibrator surface for a specific touch device
//!
//! On creation, this object is tied to a specific touch device. The
//! compositor sends a configure event which the client must obey with the
//! associated wl_surface.
//!
//! Once the client has committed content to the surface, the compositor can
//! grab the touch input device, prevent it from emitting normal touch
//! events, show the surface on the correct output, and relay input events
//! from the touch device via this protocol object.
//!
//! Touch events from other touch devices than the one tied to this object
//! must generate wrong_touch events on at least touch-down and must not
//! generate normal or calibration touch events.
//!
//! At any time, the compositor can choose to cancel the calibration
//! procedure by sending the cancel_calibration event. This should also be
//! used if the touch device disappears or anything else prevents the
//! calibration from continuing on the compositor side.
//!
//! If the wl_surface is destroyed, the compositor must cancel the
//! calibration.
//!
//! The touch event coordinates and conversion results are delivered in
//! calibration units. The calibration units cover the device coordinate
//! range exactly. Calibration units are in the closed interval [0.0, 1.0]
//! mapped into 32-bit unsigned integers. An integer can be converted into a
//! real value by dividing by 2^32-1. A calibration matrix must be computed
//! from the [0.0, 1.0] real values, but the matrix elements do not need to
//! fall into that range.
