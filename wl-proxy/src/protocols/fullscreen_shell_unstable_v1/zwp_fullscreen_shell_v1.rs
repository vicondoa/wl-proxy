//! Displays a single surface per output.
//!
//! This interface provides a mechanism for a single client to display
//! simple full-screen surfaces.  While there technically may be multiple
//! clients bound to this interface, only one of those clients should be
//! shown at a time.
//!
//! To present a surface, the client uses either the present_surface or
//! present_surface_for_mode requests.  Presenting a surface takes effect
//! on the next wl_surface.commit.  See the individual requests for
//! details about scaling and mode switches.
//!
//! The client can have at most one surface per output at any time.
//! Requesting a surface to be presented on an output that already has a
//! surface replaces the previously presented surface.  Presenting a null
//! surface removes its content and effectively disables the output.
//! Exactly what happens when an output is "disabled" is
//! compositor-specific.  The same surface may be presented on multiple
//! outputs simultaneously.
//!
//! Once a surface is presented on an output, it stays on that output
//! until either the client removes it or the compositor destroys the
//! output.  This way, the client can update the output's contents by
//! simply attaching a new buffer.
//!
//! Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
//! backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
//! may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
//! Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
//! the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
//! Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
//! version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
//! interface version number is reset.
