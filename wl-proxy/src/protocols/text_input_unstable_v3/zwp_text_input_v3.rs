//! text input
//!
//! The zwp_text_input_v3 interface represents text input and input methods
//! associated with a seat. It provides enter/leave events to follow the
//! text input focus for a seat.
//!
//! Requests are used to enable/disable the text-input object and set
//! state information like surrounding and selected text or the content type.
//! The information about the entered text is sent to the text-input object
//! via the preedit_string and commit_string events.
//!
//! Text is valid UTF-8 encoded, indices and lengths are in bytes. Indices
//! must not point to middle bytes inside a code point: they must either
//! point to the first byte of a code point or to the end of the buffer.
//! Lengths must be measured between two valid indices.
//!
//! Focus moving throughout surfaces will result in the emission of
//! zwp_text_input_v3.enter and zwp_text_input_v3.leave events. The focused
//! surface must commit zwp_text_input_v3.enable and
//! zwp_text_input_v3.disable requests as the keyboard focus moves across
//! editable and non-editable elements of the UI. Those two requests are not
//! expected to be paired with each other, the compositor must be able to
//! handle consecutive series of the same request.
//!
//! State is sent by the state requests (set_surrounding_text,
//! set_content_type and set_cursor_rectangle) and a commit request. After an
//! enter event or disable request all state information is invalidated and
//! needs to be resent by the client.
