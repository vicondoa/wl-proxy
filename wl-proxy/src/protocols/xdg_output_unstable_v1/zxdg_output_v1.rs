//! compositor logical output region
//!
//! An xdg_output describes part of the compositor geometry.
//!
//! This typically corresponds to a monitor that displays part of the

//! For objects version 3 onwards, after all xdg_output properties have been
//! sent (when the object is created and when properties are updated), a
//! wl_output.done event is sent. This allows changes to the output
//! properties to be seen as atomic, even if they happen via multiple events.
