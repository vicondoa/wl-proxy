//! parameters for creating a dmabuf-based wl_buffer
//!
//! This temporary object is a collection of dmabufs and other
//! parameters that together form a single logical buffer. The temporary
//! object may eventually create one wl_buffer unless cancelled by
//! destroying it before requesting 'create'.
//!
//! Single-planar formats only require one dmabuf, however
//! multi-planar formats may require more than one dmabuf. For all
//! formats, an 'add' request must be called once per plane (even if the
//! underlying dmabuf fd is identical).
//!
//! You must use consecutive plane indices ('plane_idx' argument for 'add')
//! from zero to the number of planes used by the drm_fourcc format code.
//! All planes required by the format must be given exactly once, but can
//! be given in any order. Each plane index can only be set once; subsequent
//! calls with a plane index which has already been set will result in a
//! plane_set error being generated.
