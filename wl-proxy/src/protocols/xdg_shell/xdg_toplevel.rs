//! toplevel surface
//!
//! This interface defines an xdg_surface role which allows a surface to,
//! among other things, set window-like properties such as maximize,
//! fullscreen, and minimize, set application-specific metadata like title and
//! id, and well as trigger user interactive operations such as interactive
//! resize and move.
//!
//! An xdg_toplevel by default is responsible for providing the full intended
//! visual representation of the toplevel, which depending on the window
//! state, may mean things like a title bar, window controls and drop shadow.
//!
//! Unmapping an xdg_toplevel means that the surface cannot be shown
//! by the compositor until it is explicitly mapped again.
//! All active operations (e.g., move, resize) are canceled and all
//! attributes (e.g. title, state, stacking, ...) are discarded for
//! an xdg_toplevel surface when it is unmapped. The xdg_toplevel returns to
//! the state it had right after xdg_surface.get_toplevel. The client
//! can re-map the toplevel by performing a commit without any buffer
//! attached, waiting for a configure event and handling it as usual (see
//! xdg_surface description).
//!
//! Attaching a null buffer to a toplevel unmaps the surface.
