//! desktop user interface surface base interface
//!
//! An interface that may be implemented by a wl_surface, for
//! implementations that provide a desktop-style user interface.
//!
//! It provides a base set of functionality required to construct user
//! interface elements requiring management by the compositor, such as
//! toplevel windows, menus, etc. The types of functionality are split into
//! xdg_surface roles.
//!
//! Creating an xdg_surface does not set the role for a wl_surface. In order
//! to map an xdg_surface, the client must create a role-specific object
//! using, e.g., get_toplevel, get_popup. The wl_surface for any given
//! xdg_surface can have at most one role, and may not be assigned any role
//! not based on xdg_surface.
//!
//! A role must be assigned before any other requests are made to the
//! xdg_surface object.
//!
//! The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface
//! for the xdg_surface state to take effect.
//!
//! Creating an xdg_surface from a wl_surface which has a buffer attached or
//! committed is a client error, and any attempts by a client to attach or
//! manipulate a buffer prior to the first xdg_surface.configure call must
//! also be treated as errors.
//!
//! After creating a role-specific object and setting it up (e.g. by sending
//! the title, app ID, size constraints, parent, etc), the client must
//! perform an initial commit without any buffer attached. The compositor
//! will reply with initial wl_surface state such as
//! wl_surface.preferred_buffer_scale followed by an xdg_surface.configure
//! event. The client must acknowledge it and is then allowed to attach a
//! buffer to map the surface.
//!
//! Mapping an xdg_surface-based role surface is defined as making it
//! possible for the surface to be shown by the compositor. Note that
//! a mapped surface is not guaranteed to be visible once it is mapped.
//!
//! For an xdg_surface to be mapped by the compositor, the following
//! conditions must be met:
//! (1) the client has assigned an xdg_surface-based role to the surface
//! (2) the client has set and committed the xdg_surface state and the
//!     role-dependent state to the surface
//! (3) the client has committed a buffer to the surface
//!
//! A newly-unmapped surface is considered to have met condition (1) out
//! of the 3 required conditions for mapping a surface if its role surface
//! has not been destroyed, i.e. the client must perform the initial commit
//! again before attaching a buffer.
