//! short-lived, popup surfaces for menus
//!
//! A popup surface is a short-lived, temporary surface. It can be used to
//! implement for example menus, popovers, tooltips and other similar user
//! interface concepts.
//!
//! A popup can be made to take an explicit grab. See xdg_popup.grab for
//! details.
//!
//! When the popup is dismissed, a popup_done event will be sent out, and at
//! the same time the surface will be unmapped. See the xdg_popup.popup_done
//! event for details.
//!
//! Explicitly destroying the xdg_popup object will also dismiss the popup and
//! unmap the surface. Clients that want to dismiss the popup when another
//! surface of their own is clicked should dismiss the popup using the destroy
//! request.
//!
//! A newly created xdg_popup will be stacked on top of all previously created
//! xdg_popup surfaces associated with the same xdg_toplevel.
//!
//! The parent of an xdg_popup must be mapped (see the xdg_surface
//! description) before the xdg_popup itself.
//!
//! The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface
//! for the xdg_popup state to take effect.
