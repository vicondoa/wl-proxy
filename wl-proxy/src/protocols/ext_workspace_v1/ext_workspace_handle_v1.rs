//! a workspace handing a group of surfaces
//!
//! A ext_workspace_handle_v1 object represents a workspace that handles a
//! group of surfaces.
//!
//! Each workspace has:
//! - a name, conveyed to the client with the name event
//! - potentially an id conveyed with the id event
//! - a list of states, conveyed to the client with the state event
//! - and optionally a set of coordinates, conveyed to the client with the
//! coordinates event
//!
//! The client may request that the compositor activate or deactivate the workspace.
//!
//! Each workspace can belong to only a single workspace group.
//! Depending on the compositor policy, there might be workspaces with
//! the same name in different workspace groups, but these workspaces are still
//! separate (e.g. one of them might be active while the other is not).
