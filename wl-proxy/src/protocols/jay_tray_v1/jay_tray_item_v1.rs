//! tray item interface
//!
//! This interface represents an item in a tray. The underlying surface will
//! be displayed in the tray.
//!
//! Unless the global has been removed, the compositor will immediately emit a
//! configuration sequence after this object has been created. If applicable,
//! the sequence will also contain wl_surface.preferred_buffer_scale and
//! wp_fractional_scale_v1.preferred_scale events.
//!
//! After receiving the configuration sequence, the client must ack the
//! configuration and commit the surface. The item will not be displayed
//! before this.
//!
//! The compositor can send configuration sequences at any point.
//!
//! If a null buffer is committed, the item will not be displayed.
//! If the client wants the item to be displayed, it must ack and commit the
//! latest configuration sequence and attach and commit a non-null buffer.
