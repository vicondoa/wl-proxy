//! output color properties

//! A wp_color_management_output_v1 describes the color properties of an
//! output.
//!
//! The wp_color_management_output_v1 is associated with the wl_output global
//! underlying the wl_output object. Therefore the client destroying the
//! wl_output object has no impact, but the compositor removing the output
//! global makes the wp_color_management_output_v1 object inert.
