//! Colorimetric image description
//!
//! An image description carries information about the pixel color encoding
//! and its intended display and viewing environment. The image description is
//! attached to a wl_surface via
//! wp_color_management_surface_v1.set_image_description. A compositor can use
//! this information to decode pixel values into colorimetrically meaningful
//! quantities, which allows the compositor to transform the surface contents
//! to become suitable for various displays and viewing environments.
//!
//! Note, that the wp_image_description_v1 object is not ready to be used
//! immediately after creation. The object eventually delivers either the
//! 'ready' or the 'failed' event, specified in all requests creating it. The
//! object is deemed "ready" after receiving the 'ready' event.
//!
//! An object which is not ready is illegal to use, it can only be destroyed.
//! Any other request in this interface shall result in the 'not_ready'
//! protocol error. Attempts to use an object which is not ready through other
//! interfaces shall raise protocol errors defined there.
//!
//! Once created and regardless of how it was created, a
//! wp_image_description_v1 object always refers to one fixed image
//! description. It cannot change after creation.
