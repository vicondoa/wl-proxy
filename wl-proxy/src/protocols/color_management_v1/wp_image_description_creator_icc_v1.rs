//! holder of image description ICC information
//!
//! This type of object is used for collecting all the information required
//! to create a wp_image_description_v1 object from an ICC file. A complete
//! set of required parameters consists of these properties:
//! - ICC file
//!
//! Each required property must be set exactly once if the client is to create
//! an image description. The set requests verify that a property was not
//! already set. The create request verifies that all required properties are
//! set. There may be several alternative requests for setting each property,
//! and in that case the client must choose one of them.
//!
//! Once all properties have been set, the create request must be used to
//! create the image description object, destroying the creator in the
//! process.
//!
//! The link between a pixel value (a device value in ICC) and its respective
//! colorimetry is defined by the details of the particular ICC profile.
//! Those details also determine when colorimetry becomes undefined.
