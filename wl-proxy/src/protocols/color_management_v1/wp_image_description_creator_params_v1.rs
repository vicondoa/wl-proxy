//! holder of image description parameters
//!
//! This type of object is used for collecting all the parameters required
//! to create a wp_image_description_v1 object. A complete set of required
//! parameters consists of these properties:
//! - transfer characteristic function (tf)
//! - chromaticities of primaries and white point (primary color volume)
//!
//! The following properties are optional and have a well-defined default
//! if not explicitly set:
//! - primary color volume luminance range
//! - reference white luminance level
//! - mastering display primaries and white point (target color volume)
//! - mastering luminance range
//!
//! The following properties are optional and will be ignored
//! if not explicitly set:
//! - maximum content light level
//! - maximum frame-average light level
//!
//! Each required property must be set exactly once if the client is to create
//! an image description. The set requests verify that a property was not
//! already set. The create request verifies that all required properties are
//! set. There may be several alternative requests for setting each property,
//! and in that case the client must choose one of them.
//!
//! Once all properties have been set, the create request must be used to
//! create the image description object, destroying the creator in the
//! process.
//!
//! A viewer, who is viewing the display defined by the resulting image
//! description (the viewing environment included), is assumed to be fully
//! adapted to the primary color volume's white point.
//!
//! Any of the following conditions will cause the colorimetry of a pixel
//! to become undefined:
//! - Values outside of the defined range of the transfer characteristic.
//! - Tristimulus that exceeds the target color volume.
//! - If extended_target_volume is not supported: tristimulus that exceeds
//! the primary color volume.
//!
//! The closest correspondence to an image description created through this
//! interface is the Display class of profiles in ICC.
