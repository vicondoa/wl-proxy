//! per-surface explicit synchronization support
//!
//! This object implements per-surface explicit synchronization.
//!
//! Synchronization refers to co-ordination of pipelined operations performed
//! on buffers. Most GPU clients will schedule an asynchronous operation to
//! render to the buffer, then immediately send the buffer to the compositor
//! to be attached to a surface.
//!
//! In implicit synchronization, ensuring that the rendering operation is
//! complete before the compositor displays the buffer is an implementation
//! detail handled by either the kernel or userspace graphics driver.
//!
//! By contrast, in explicit synchronization, dma_fence objects mark when the
//! asynchronous operations are complete. When submitting a buffer, the
//! client provides an acquire fence which will be waited on before the
//! compositor accesses the buffer. The Wayland server, through a
//! zwp_linux_buffer_release_v1 object, will inform the client with an event
//! which may be accompanied by a release fence, when the compositor will no
//! longer access the buffer contents due to the specific commit that
//! requested the release event.
//!
//! Each surface can be associated with only one object of this interface at
//! any time.
//!
//! In version 1 of this interface, explicit synchronization is only
//! guaranteed to be supported for buffers created with any version of the
//! wp_linux_dmabuf buffer factory. Version 2 additionally guarantees
//! explicit synchronization support for opaque EGL buffers, which is a type
//! of platform specific buffers described in the EGL_WL_bind_wayland_display
//! extension. Compositors are free to support explicit synchronization for
//! additional buffer types.
