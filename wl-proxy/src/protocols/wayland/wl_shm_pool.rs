//! a shared memory pool
//!
//! The wl_shm_pool object encapsulates a piece of memory shared
//! between the compositor and client.  Through the wl_shm_pool
//! object, the client can allocate shared memory wl_buffer objects.
//! All objects created through the same pool share the same
//! underlying mapped memory. Reusing the mapped memory avoids the
//! setup/teardown overhead and is useful when interactively resizing
//! a surface or for many small buffers.
