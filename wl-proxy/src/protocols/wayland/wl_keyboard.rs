//! keyboard input device
//!
//! The wl_keyboard interface represents one or more keyboards
//! associated with a seat.
//!
//! Each wl_keyboard has the following logical state:
//!
//! - an active surface (possibly null),
//! - the keys currently logically down,
//! - the active modifiers,
//! - the active group.
//!
//! By default, the active surface is null, the keys currently logically down
//! are empty, the active modifiers and the active group are 0.
