//! offer to transfer data
//!
//! A wl_data_offer represents a piece of data offered for transfer
//! by another client (the source client).  It is used by the
//! copy-and-paste and drag-and-drop mechanisms.  The offer
//! describes the different mime types that the data can be
//! converted to and provides the mechanism for transferring the
//! data directly from the source client.
