//! compositor output region
//!
//! An output describes part of the compositor geometry.  The
//! compositor works in the 'compositor coordinate system' and an
//! output corresponds to a rectangular area in that space that is
//! actually visible.  This typically corresponds to a monitor that
//! displays part of the compositor space.  This object is published
//! as global during start up, or when a monitor is hotplugged.
