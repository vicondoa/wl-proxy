//! touchscreen input device
//!
//! The wl_touch interface represents a touchscreen
//! associated with a seat.
//!
//! Touch interactions can consist of one or more contacts.
//! For each contact, a series of events is generated, starting
//! with a down event, followed by zero or more motion events,
//! and ending with an up event. Events relating to the same
//! contact point can be identified by the ID of the sequence.
