//! an onscreen surface
//!
//! A surface is a rectangular area that may be displayed on zero
//! or more outputs, and shown any number of times at the compositor's
//! discretion. They can present wl_buffers, receive user input, and
//! define a local coordinate system.
//!
//! The size of a surface (and relative positions on it) is described
//! in surface-local coordinates, which may differ from the buffer
//! coordinates of the pixel content, in case a buffer_transform
//! or a buffer_scale is used.
//!
//! A surface without a "role" is fairly useless: a compositor does
//! not know where, when or how to present it. The role is the
//! purpose of a wl_surface. Examples of roles are a cursor for a
//! pointer (as set by wl_pointer.set_cursor), a drag icon
//! (wl_data_device.start_drag), a sub-surface
//! (wl_subcompositor.get_subsurface), and a window as defined by a
//! shell protocol (e.g. wl_shell.get_shell_surface).
//!
//! A surface can have only one role at a time. Initially a
//! wl_surface does not have a role. Once a wl_surface is given a
//! role, it is set permanently for the whole lifetime of the
//! wl_surface object. Giving the current role again is allowed,
//! unless explicitly forbidden by the relevant interface
//! specification.
//!
//! Surface roles are given by requests in other interfaces such as
//! wl_pointer.set_cursor. The request should explicitly mention
//! that this request gives a role to a wl_surface. Often, this
//! request also creates a new protocol object that represents the
//! role and adds additional functionality to wl_surface. When a
//! client wants to destroy a wl_surface, they must destroy this role
//! object before the wl_surface, otherwise a defunct_role_object error is
//! sent.
//!
//! Destroying the role object does not remove the role from the
//! wl_surface, but it may stop the wl_surface from "playing the role".
//! For instance, if a wl_subsurface object is destroyed, the wl_surface
//! it was created for will be unmapped and forget its position and
//! z-order. It is allowed to create a wl_subsurface for the same
//! wl_surface again, but it is not allowed to use the wl_surface as
//! a cursor (cursor is a different role than sub-surface, and role
//! switching is not allowed).
