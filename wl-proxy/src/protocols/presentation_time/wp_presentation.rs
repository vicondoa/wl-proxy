//! timed presentation related wl_surface requests
//!
//! The main feature of this interface is accurate presentation
//! timing feedback to ensure smooth video playback while maintaining
//! audio/video synchronization. Some features use the concept of a
//! presentation clock, which is defined in the
//! presentation.clock_id event.
//!
//! A content update for a wl_surface is submitted by a
//! wl_surface.commit request. Request 'feedback' associates with
//! the wl_surface.commit and provides feedback on the content
//! update, particularly the final realized presentation time.
//!
//!
//!
//! When the final realized presentation time is available, e.g.
//! after a framebuffer flip completes, the requested
//! presentation_feedback.presented events are sent. The final
//! presentation time can differ from the compositor's predicted
//! display update time and the update's target time, especially
//! when the compositor misses its target vertical blanking period.
