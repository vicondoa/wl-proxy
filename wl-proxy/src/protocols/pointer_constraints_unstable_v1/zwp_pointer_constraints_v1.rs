//! constrain the movement of a pointer
//!
//! The global interface exposing pointer constraining functionality. It
//! exposes two requests: lock_pointer for locking the pointer to its
//! position, and confine_pointer for locking the pointer to a region.
//!
//! The lock_pointer and confine_pointer requests create the objects
//! wp_locked_pointer and wp_confined_pointer respectively, and the client can
//! use these objects to interact with the lock.
//!
//! For any surface, only one lock or confinement may be active across all
//! wl_pointer objects of the same seat. If a lock or confinement is requested
//! when another lock or confinement is active or requested on the same surface
//! and with any of the wl_pointer objects of the same seat, an
//! 'already_constrained' error will be raised.
