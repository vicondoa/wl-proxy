//! input method
//!
//! An input method object allows for clients to compose text.
//!
//! The objects connects the client to a text input in an application, and
//! lets the client to serve as an input method for a seat.
//!
//! The zwp_input_method_v2 object can occupy two distinct states: active and
//! inactive. In the active state, the object is associated to and
//! communicates with a text input. In the inactive state, there is no
//! associated text input, and the only communication is with the compositor.
//! Initially, the input method is in the inactive state.
//!
//! Requests issued in the inactive state must be accepted by the compositor.
//! Because of the serial mechanism, and the state reset on activate event,
//! they will not have any effect on the state of the next text input.
//!
//! There must be no more than one input method object per seat.
