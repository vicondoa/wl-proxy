//! per-surface explicit synchronization
//!
//! This object is an add-on interface for wl_surface to enable explicit
//! synchronization.
//!
//! Each surface can be associated with only one object of this interface at
//! any time.
//!
//! Explicit synchronization is guaranteed to be supported for buffers
//! created with any version of the linux-dmabuf protocol. Compositors are
//! free to support explicit synchronization for additional buffer types.
//! If at surface commit time the attached buffer does not support explicit
//! synchronization, an unsupported_buffer error is raised.
//!
//! As long as the wp_linux_drm_syncobj_surface_v1 object is alive, the
//! compositor may ignore implicit synchronization for buffers attached and
//! committed to the wl_surface. The delivery of wl_buffer.release events
//! for buffers attached to the surface becomes undefined.
//!
//! Clients must set both acquire and release points if and only if a
//! non-null buffer is attached in the same surface commit. See the
//! no_buffer, no_acquire_point and no_release_point protocol errors.
//!
//! If at surface commit time the acquire and release DRM syncobj timelines
//! are identical, the acquire point value must be strictly less than the
//! release point value, or else the conflicting_points protocol error is
//! raised.

    /// Once the timeline point is signaled, and assuming the associated buffer
    /// is not pending release from other wl_surface.commit requests, no
    /// additional explicit or implicit synchronization with the compositor is
    /// required to safely re-use the buffer.
    ///
    /// Note that clients cannot rely on the release point being always
    /// signaled after the acquire point: compositors may release buffers
    /// without ever reading from them. In addition, the compositor may use
    /// different presentation paths for different commits, which may have
    /// different release behavior. As a result, the compositor may signal the
    /// release points in a different order than the client committed them.
    ///
    /// Because signaling a timeline point also signals every previous point,
    /// it is generally not safe to use the same timeline object for the
    /// release points of multiple buffers. The out-of-order signaling
    /// described above may lead to a release point being signaled before the
    /// compositor has finished reading. To avoid this, it is strongly
    /// recommended that each buffer should use a separate timeline for its
    /// release points.
    ///
    /// The 64-bit unsigned value combined from point_hi and point_lo is the
    /// point value.
    ///
    /// The release point is double-buffered state, and will be applied on the
    /// next wl_surface.commit request for the associated surface. Thus, it
    /// applies only to the buffer that is attached to the surface at commit
    /// time.
    ///
    /// If a release point has already been attached during the same commit
    /// cycle, the new point replaces the old one.
    ///
    /// If the associated wl_surface was destroyed, a no_surface error is
    /// raised.
    ///
    /// If at surface commit time there is a pending release timeline point set
    /// but no pending buffer attached, a no_buffer error is raised. If at
    /// surface commit time there is a pending buffer attached but no pending
