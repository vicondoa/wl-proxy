//! A session for an application

//! A xdg_session_v1 object represents a session for an application. While the

//! have states stored by the compositor which can be reapplied at a later
//! time. Two sessions cannot exist for the same identifier string.
//!
//! States for surfaces added to a session are automatically updated by the
