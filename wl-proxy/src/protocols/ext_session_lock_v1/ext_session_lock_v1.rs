//! manage lock state and create lock surfaces
//!
//! In response to the creation of this object the compositor must send
//! either the locked or finished event.
//!
//! The locked event indicates that the session is locked. This means
//! that the compositor must stop rendering and providing input to normal
//! clients. Instead the compositor must blank all outputs with an opaque
//! color such that their normal content is fully hidden.
//!
//! The only surfaces that should be rendered while the session is locked
//! are the lock surfaces created through this interface and optionally,
//! at the compositor's discretion, special privileged surfaces such as
//! input methods or portions of desktop shell UIs.
//!
//! The locked event must not be sent until a new "locked" frame (either
//! from a session lock surface or the compositor blanking the output) has
//! been presented on all outputs and no security sensitive normal/unlocked
//! content is possibly visible.
//!
//! The finished event should be sent immediately on creation of this
//! object if the compositor decides that the locked event will not be sent.
//!
//! The compositor may wait for the client to create and render session lock
//! surfaces before sending the locked event to avoid displaying intermediate
//! blank frames. However, it must impose a reasonable time limit if
//! waiting and send the locked event as soon as the hard requirements
//! described above can be met if the time limit expires. Clients should
//! immediately create lock surfaces for all outputs on creation of this
//! object to make this possible.
//!
//! This behavior of the locked event is required in order to prevent
//! possible race conditions with clients that wish to suspend the system
//! or similar after locking the session. Without these semantics, clients
//! triggering a suspend after receiving the locked event would race with
//! the first "locked" frame being presented and normal/unlocked frames
//! might be briefly visible as the system is resumed if the suspend
//! operation wins the race.
//!
//! If the client dies while the session is locked, the compositor must not
//! unlock the session in response. It is acceptable for the session to be
//! permanently locked if this happens. The compositor may choose to continue
//! to display the lock surfaces the client had mapped before it died or
//! alternatively fall back to a solid color, this is compositor policy.
//!
//! Compositors may also allow a secure way to recover the session, the
//! details of this are compositor policy. Compositors may allow a new
//! client to create a ext_session_lock_v1 object and take responsibility
//! for unlocking the session, they may even start a new lock client
//! instance automatically.
