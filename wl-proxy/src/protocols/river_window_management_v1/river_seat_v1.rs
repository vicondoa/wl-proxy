//! a window management seat
//!
//! This object represents a single user's collection of input devices. It
//! allows the window manager to route keyboard input to windows, get
//! high-level information about pointer input, define pointer bindings, etc.
//!
//! For keyboard bindings, see the river-xkb-bindings-v1 protocol.
//!
//! Since version 4: The cursor surface/shape set by the window manager on the
//! wl_pointer of this seat is used when no client has pointer focus, for
//! example during a pointer operation. Since the window manager is allowed to
//! set cursor surface/shape even when it does not have pointer focus, the
//! compositor must ignore the serial argument of wl_pointer.set_cursor and
//! wp_cursor_shape_device_v1.set_shape requests made by the window manager.
//!
//! The most recent cursor surface/shape set by the window manager is
//! remembered by the compositor and restored whenever no client has pointer
//! focus. If the window manager never sets a cursor surface/shape, the
//! "default" shape is used.
