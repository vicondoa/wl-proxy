//! configure a pointer binding, receive trigger events
//!
//! This object allows the window manager to configure a pointer binding and
//! receive events when the binding is triggered.
//!
//! The new pointer binding is not enabled until the enable request is made
//! during a manage sequence.
//!
//! Normally, all pointer button events are sent to the surface with pointer
//! focus by the compositor. Pointer button events that trigger a pointer
//! binding are not sent to the surface with pointer focus.
//!
//! If multiple pointer bindings would be triggered by a single physical
//! pointer event on the compositor side, it is compositor policy which
//! pointer binding(s) will receive press/release events or if all of the
//! matched pointer bindings receive press/release events.
