//! window manager global interface
//!
//! This global interface should only be advertised to the window manager
//! process. Only one window management client may be active at a time. The
//! compositor should use the unavailable event if necessary to enforce this.
//!
//! There are two disjoint categories of state managed by this protocol:
//!
//! Window management state influences the communication between the
//! compositor and individual windows (e.g. xdg_toplevels). Window management
//! state includes window dimensions, fullscreen state, keyboard focus,
//! keyboard bindings, and more.
//!
//! Rendering state only affects the rendered output of the compositor and
//! does not influence communication between the compositor and individual
//! windows. Rendering state includes the position and rendering order of
//! windows, shell surfaces, decoration surfaces, borders, and more.
//!
//! Window management state may only be modified by the window manager as part
//! of a manage sequence. A manage sequence is started with the manage_start
//! event and ended with the manage_finish request. It is a protocol error to
//! modify window management state outside of a manage sequence.
//!
//! A manage sequence is always followed by at least one render sequence. A
//! render sequence is started with the render_start event and ended with the
//! render_finish request.
//!
//! Rendering state may be modified by the window manager during a manage
//! sequence or a render sequence. Regardless of when the rendering state is
//! modified, it is applied with the next render_finish request. It is a
//! protocol error to modify rendering state outside of a manage or render
//! sequence.
//!
//! The server will start a manage sequence by sending new state and the
//! manage_start event as soon as possible whenever there is a change in state
//! that must be communicated with the window manager.
//!
//! If the window manager client needs to ensure a manage sequence is started
//! due to a state change the compositor is not aware of, it may send the
//! manage_dirty request.
//!
//! The server will start a render sequence by sending new state and the
//! render_start event as soon as possible whenever there is a change in
//! window dimensions that must be communicated with the window manager.
//! Multiple render sequences may be made consecutively without a manage
//! sequence in between, for example if a window independently changes its own
//! dimensions.
//!
//! To summarize, the main loop of this protocol is as follows:
//!
//! 1. The server sends events indicating all changes since the last
//!    manage sequence followed by the manage_start event.
//!
//! 2. The client sends requests modifying window management state or
//!    rendering state (as defined above) followed by the manage_finish
//!    request.
//!
//! 3. The server sends new state to windows and waits for responses.
//!
//! 4. The server sends new window dimensions to the client followed by the
//!    render_start event.
//!
//! 5. The client sends requests modifying rendering state (as defined above)
//!    followed by the render_finish request.
//!
//! 6. If window dimensions change, loop back to step 4.
//!    If state that requires a manage sequence changes or if the client makes
//!    a manage_dirty request, loop back to step 1.
//!
//! For the purposes of frame perfection, the server may delay rendering new
//! state committed by the windows in step 3 until after step 5 is finished.
//!
//! It is a protocol error for the client to make a manage_finish or
//! render_finish request that violates this ordering.
