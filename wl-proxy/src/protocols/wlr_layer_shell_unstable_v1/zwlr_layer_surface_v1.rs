//! layer metadata interface
//!
//! An interface that may be implemented by a wl_surface, for surfaces that
//! are designed to be rendered as a layer of a stacked desktop-like
//! environment.
//!
//! Layer surface state (layer, size, anchor, exclusive zone,
//! margin, interactivity) is double-buffered, and will be applied at the
//! time wl_surface.commit of the corresponding wl_surface is called.
//!
//! Attaching a null buffer to a layer surface unmaps it.
//!
//! Unmapping a layer_surface means that the surface cannot be shown by the
//! compositor until it is explicitly mapped again. The layer_surface
//! returns to the state it had right after layer_shell.get_layer_surface.
//! The client can re-map the surface by performing a commit without any
//! buffer attached, waiting for a configure event and handling it as usual.
