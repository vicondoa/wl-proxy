//! content protection interface to a wl_surface
//!
//! An additional interface to a wl_surface object, which allows a client to
//! request the minimum level of content-protection, request to change the
//! visibility of their contents, and receive notifications about changes in
//! content-protection.
//!
//! A protected surface has a 'status' associated with it, that indicates
//! what type of protection it is currently providing, specified by
//! content-type. Updates to this status are sent to the client
//! via the 'status' event. Before the first status event is sent, the client
//! should assume that the status is 'unprotected'.
//!
//! A client can request a content protection level to be the minimum for an
//! output to be considered secure, using the 'set_type' request.
//! It is responsibility of the client to monitor the actual
//! content-protection level achieved via the 'status' event, and make
//! decisions as to what content to show based on this.
//!
//! The server should make its best effort to achieve the desired
//! content-protection level on all of the outputs the client's contents are
//! being displayed on. Any changes to the content protection status should be
//! reported to the client, even if they are below the requested
//! content-protection level. If the client's contents are being displayed on
//! multiple outputs, the lowest content protection level achieved should be
//! reported.
//!
//! A client can also request that its content only be displayed on outputs
//! that are considered secure. The 'enforce/relax' requests can achieve this.
//! In enforce mode, the content is censored for non-secure outputs.
//! The implementation of censored-visibility is compositor-defined.
//! In relax mode there are no such limitation. On an attempt to show the
//! client on unsecured output, compositor would keep on showing the content
//! and send the 'status' event to the client. Client can take a call to
//! downgrade the content.
//!
//! If the wl_surface associated with the protected_surface is destroyed,
//! the protected_surface becomes inert.
